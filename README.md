## Introduction
The MERN Library Management System is designed to modernize library operations by tackling key inefficiencies such as dependency on physical library cards and the absence of a recommendation system. Developed as part of the Information Technology Project (ITP), this system leverages the MERN stack with a TypeScript template to deliver an intuitive and efficient solution for librarians, library users, and guests.<br>
With features like QR code-based book loans, automated return tracking, TF-IDF-powered recommendations, and third-party API integration, this project showcases cutting-edge web technologies aimed at enhancing user experience and optimizing data management.

## Features
- **User Authentication:** Secure login system for librarians and users, leveraging JWT.
- **Library Data Management:** CRUD functionality for users, books, contacts, and book metadata.
- **QR Code Book Loans:** Scan QR codes to borrow books seamlessly.
- **Loan & Return Tracking:** Log borrowing transactions, returns, and fine management.
- **Book Recommendation System:** Uses TF-IDF and loan data analysis for personalized suggestions.
- **Third-Party API Integration:** Fetch book details (ratings, ISBN, etc.) via the Google Books API.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TomWai821/MERN_LibraryManagementSystem.git
   cd MERN_LibraryManagementSystem

2. **Download dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install

3. **Set up environment variable:**
   Create a .env file in client directories based on the configuration part

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   # For the server side
   nodemon backend/index.ts  
   
   # For the client side
   npm start
   
   # For the user who download concurrency
   npm run both
